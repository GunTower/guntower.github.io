  <h1><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;intro&#x2F;">I should have started this blog 15 years ago</a></h1>

  <div class="post-content"><p>Hello there! This is a software engineer with 20+ years experience in the field. Currently working as SDE (Software Development Engineer) for Amazon. I always thought about about writing my own blog, but as time went by, I kept procrastinating.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>As an intent of become a better professional, I'm looking forward to start this blog. Mainly for myself, but happy if it also help others. </p>
<p>The goal is to share tech and non-tech experience on the Software world. I will use this also as a Journal, something that helps me put thoughts down, and organize them.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
